# Something from the 90's

I was thinking about two ridiculous shoe trends in the 90s: **LA Lights** and **Reebok Pumps**. The former were light up sneakers with embedded LEDs while the latter were sneakers with air pumps for adjustable cushioning.

## LA Lights
I'm not quite sure how thse worked, but they had some kind of step-detection mechanism and would flash the lights in various patterns as you walked. All the cool kids had them.

## Reebok Pumps
These kicks had a round button in the tongue that you could use to pump up your shoes. I think there was something about adjusting inflation in the tongue and around the ankle for support, but come on, everyone just wanted to PUMP IT UP.

## Combine the Two
I thought it was a hilarious idea to combine these two concepts such that you needed to pump up your shoes in order to get activity & animation from the LEDs. After walking around a bit or having been active, your shoes would be dim and perhaps just slowly fade on and off. But after PUMPING THEM UP, you'd get crazy activity all over them! Check out this video from Adafruit on their LED strip shoe video:
